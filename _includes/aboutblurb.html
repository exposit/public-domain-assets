<p>	This is a small, curated collection of public domain (pre-1920s) assets taken from public domain books on the <a href="archive.org">internet archive</a> and converted to vector formats, with an eye for ones that might be useful in tabletop rpg design. The eps format may or may not be suitable for your project, as it tends to have a fairly distinctive look. The benefit is that it is scalable and easy to edit as a vector. You can do some neat stuff with it!</p>
